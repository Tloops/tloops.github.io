Hi there, welcome! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">

I'm Qiushi Nie (ËÅÇÁßãÂÆû), currently pursuing master's degree at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](www.sustech.edu.cn) in [iMED](https://www.imed-lab.com/) research group supervised by [Jiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NHt3fUcAAAAJ). I am passionate about medical image analysis and eager to learn the state-of-the-art advances in deep learning. I'm currently working on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) segmentation. 

As this is the last year of my master's degree, now I am actively looking for PhD opportunities related to medical image analysis!

## Highlights

Remarkably, I was teaching Java in SUSTech as a tutor and had gained lots of compliment and supports. Until now, nearly **1,600+** students (40% of total undergraduates) in SUSTech had taken my classes. And I'm really enjoying teaching Java and helping noobs with fixing their bugs.
