Hi there, welcome! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">

I'm Qiushi Nie (ËÅÇÁßãÂÆû), currently pursuing master's degree at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in the [iMED](https://www.imed-lab.com/) research group supervised by [Jiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NHt3fUcAAAAJ). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2022.

My research goal is to develop deep learning algorithms that can be applied to medical images to assist doctors in diagnosis and surgical planning and benefit people's health. To this end, my interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, medical image analysis, and computer vision. Currently, I'm working on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) segmentation.

As this is the last year of my master's degree, I am now actively looking for PhD opportunities!

## Honors & Awards üèÜ

- [2018-2020] The second prize of outstanding student scholarship in SUSTech
- [2020-2021] The first prize of outstanding student scholarship in SUSTech
- [2022] The Outstanding Graduates Prize in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SUSTech
- [2022] The Top Ten Graduates Nomination Award in SUSTech
- [2023] The Star of iMED Award (for those who contributed most in my research group iMED)
- [2021-2023] The Outstanding Teaching Assistant in SUSTech

## Highlights

Remarkably, I was teaching Java in SUSTech as a tutor and gained many compliments and support. Until now, nearly **1,600+** students (40% of total undergraduates) in SUSTech have taken my classes. And I'm enjoying teaching and helping noobs with fixing their bugs.

My research group, iMED, has just started to explore Education Intelligence, which aims to empower education with AI. I am one of the core members. I like to help others, and it would be even cooler if I could design an AI assistant to make help more convenient and timely!

## Hobbies

Beyond academics, I have a wide range of interests. I enjoy singing and sometimes rap. I have performed on many big stages (though they weren't actually that big, haha). 

Recently, I've become fascinated with board games, particularly strategy ones like **Ark Nova**, for their strategic depth and requirement for long-term planning and rational competition.
