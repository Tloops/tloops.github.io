*After-school Tutor* of this course in Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Fall 2021, and Spring 2022. *Teaching Assistant* of this course in Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021, and Spring 2022.



## Duties

### After-school Tutor

- gave extra lectures of the course every weekend, provide assistance to studentsâ€™ coursework.
  - homework debugging (debugging is painful!)
- held review sessions every semester before final exam.
  - Remarkably, my classes were so popular that more than 1600 students (40% of total undergraduates in SUSTech) had taken my classes.
- wrote courseware by myself in Chinese ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Tloops/Java-Courseware)). Special thank to [Shilong Li](https://lethal233.github.io/) for his contribution to my courseware repo.

I was encouraged to give my second Java final review class in Spring 2020 after Covid19. So many students were coming!
