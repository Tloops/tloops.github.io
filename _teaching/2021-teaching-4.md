I held a volunteered final review session of this course in Fall 2021.



## Course Intro

The "Introduction to Computer Science" course was mandatory for freshman who failed in the placement exam of basic computer knowledge at the beginning of the semester. However, this course covered a wide range of complex topics, including Turing machines, algorithms, programming languages, and operating systems, without considering the varying levels of understanding among freshmen. Additionally, the strict teaching approach has led to a negative perception of the course among many students. In order to let students regain their interest in computer science and improve their grades, I opened this review course.

PS: This course has been canceled since 2022 regarding the retirement of the instructor.



## Duties

- Wrote courseware by myself in Chinese ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Tloops/CS101B_I2CSB)).
- The overall grade of this course has increased by 8 points compared to previous year (Fall 2020).



## Moments

I was explaining the five components of computer architecture (maybe?). On the blackboard behind me shown two state transition diagrams of Turing machine and a gate circuit.
