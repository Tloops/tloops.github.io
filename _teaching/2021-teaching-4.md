I held a volunteered final review session of this course in Fall 2021.



## Course Intro

Introduction to Computer Science was a course for freshman, and was mandatory if they failed in the placement exam of computer basic knowledge at the beginning of the semester. However, However, this course involves a vast amount of computer-related knowledge, such as Turing machines, algorithms, programming languages, operating systems, etc., and did not take into account the understanding ability of freshmen. In addition, the teacher of this course is quite strict, which makes many students hate this course. In order to let students regain their interest in computers and to improve their grades, I opened this review course.



## Duties

- Write courseware by myself in Chinese ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Tloops/CS101B_I2CSB))
- The overall rating of this course has increased by 8 points compared to Fall 2020



## Moments

I was explaining the five components of computer architecture (maybe?). On the blackboard behind me shown two state transition diagrams of Turing machine and a gate circuit.
